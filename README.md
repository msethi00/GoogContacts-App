1) App can be run in iphone Simulator or Device.

2) - The app prompts the user for their Google Username and Password. It then downloads the Users contact information and displays in tableform. - Simple contact details can be seen when user selects any given contact from the returned contact list. - Once user logs in once the username and password are saved locally on the device and the next time the app is launched the user does not have to re-enter in their credentials.

3) - Given more time I would have like to save the contact list locally also incase the user doesn't have an internet connection. - I would also have liked to have fetched the data using a background thread when the user logs in after the first time. - I would have like to show more details in the contact details. - I would have improved the UI.

4) Given more time I would have like to put in test conditions to make the app more robust. - I would also like to test the app more under different internet conditions (ie no internet, slow internet) - I would also like to test conditions when user has too many contacts.
